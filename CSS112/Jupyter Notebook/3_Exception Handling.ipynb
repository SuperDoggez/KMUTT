    "We open fear.txt and we read its content into a list. Then we create a new file, raef.txt, which will contain the horizontally-mirrored version of the original one. We write all the content of lines with a single operation, using join on a new line character. Maybe more interesting, is the bit in the end. First, we reassign lines to a sanitized version of itself, by means of list comprehension. Then we put them together in the whole string, and finally, we pass the result to Counter. Notice that we split the string and put it in lowercase. This way, each word will be counted correctly, regardless of its case, and, thanks to split, we don't need to worry about extra spaces anywhere. When we print the three most common words, we realize that truly Thich Nhat Hanh's focus is on others, as we is the most common word in the text:"
